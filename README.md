# rubocop-standard


## Description
This is the standard `.rubocop.yml` file to be used for grading in the Rails DA. The idea came from [Shadae Holmes's article](http://adadevacademy.tumblr.com/post/78135681910/how-to-get-rubocop-to-ignore-string-literals) on getting Rubocop to ignore String Literals.

## Installation

Run this command in your terminal:

```curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/D32-rails/dottemplates/master/install.rb | ruby```

It will automatically fetch the latest versions of the config files and install them to the current directory.
